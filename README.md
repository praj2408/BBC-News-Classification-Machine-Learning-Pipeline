# BBC-News-Classification-Machine-Learning-Pipeline



## Problem Statement:
BBC News is a well-known media organization that produces news content in various categories such as Politics, Business, Entertainment, Sport, and Technology. With a vast amount of news articles published daily, categorizing them accurately is essential for efficient information retrieval and organization. Automating the classification of news articles can save time and resources while improving the user experience.

## Project Objective:
The objective of this data science project is to develop a text classification model that can accurately categorize news articles into predefined categories. By analyzing the textual content of news articles, the goal is to create a model that can classify new and unseen articles into one of the BBC News categories. This will enhance content organization and improve user access to relevant news articles.

## Dataset:
The project will use a dataset containing a collection of news articles from BBC News, with each article labeled with its corresponding category (e.g., Politics, Business, Entertainment, Sport, Technology). This labeled dataset will serve as the training and evaluation data for building and assessing the classification model.

## Key Tasks:

Data Collection: Gather a labeled dataset of BBC News articles, ensuring that it covers a diverse range of topics within each category.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data, including tasks such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming or lemmatization.

Feature Extraction: Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models. Common techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe).

Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning or deep learning algorithms for text classification. Common models include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and neural networks like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or Transformer-based models.

Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, and train the chosen classification model(s) on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its classification performance.

Interpretability: Interpret the model's predictions and explore which words or features contribute most to classifying articles into specific categories.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model into a production environment where it can automatically categorize new and incoming news articles.

Monitoring: Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it as needed to adapt to changing news article patterns and improve accuracy.

## Deliverables:

A well-documented data science project that includes code, data preprocessing steps, model training and evaluation, and interpretation of results.
A text classification model capable of accurately categorizing news articles into BBC News categories.
Recommendations for implementing the model in a real-world news organization's workflow.
## Success Criteria:
The project's success will be measured based on the model's classification accuracy and its ability to categorize new and unseen news articles effectively. The goal is to create a model that outperforms baseline methods and provides value to the BBC News organization by automating the categorization process.
